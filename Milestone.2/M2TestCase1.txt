The following is an accepted test case by my text editor:

var a print ( a ) 

this statement is colored blue upon pressing the "colorize" button, and it denotes that it 
is a print statement. This is because swing does not allow only certain text to be colored
differently - all the text must be one color using the .setForegroundColor method.

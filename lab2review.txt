Correctness:

- The program produces correct output.

- The program produces output in the incorrect format. When I run the program
  it gives the incorrect output. I think you misunderstood the handout. If I do
  this:
$ java driverDFA gncgwng
 java driverDFA 
it just prints java driverDFA over and over again. But if I type test case,
then it produces correct output. Like this:
$ java driverDFA gncgwng
 java driverDFA gncgwng
This is a solution
but this is not the way the program should work. Talk to me if you have
questions.


Style:

- Both files have some style problems. You are not following the style
  guidelines.

- Incorrect indentation in both the driver and ManWolf files. Please use a
  two-space indentation.

- Good block comments

- Both files are missing the header. Remember: Each file must have a block
  comment at the top which gives the name of the file, the student's name, the
  assignment, the date, the version, and a comment about what is contained in
  the file. For example:
/**
 * file: SinglyLinkedList.java
 * author: student name
 * course: CMPT 220
 * assignment: project 1
 * due date: August 30, 2003
 * version: 1.3
 * 
 * This file contains the declaration of the SinglyLinkedList abstract data
 * type.
 */

- Classes do not have a (good) description. Each class declaration must have a
  comment block before it, which gives the class name and describes the purpose
  of the class. Here is an example:
/**
 * SinglyLinkedList
 * 
 * This class implements a linked list with single forward links, and supports
 * dynamic addition and deletion of nodes. 
 */
public class SinglyLinkedList {
  // ...
}


Efficiency and Other Comments:

- Program is efficient as implemented.


CSV files:

- CSV files contain State-transition table and description of states.
